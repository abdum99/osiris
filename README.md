# osiris
[WIP] Home Server to control a bunch of random IoT projects

## Installation
Osiris uses MQTT to communicate. Make sure to install an mqtt broker and run it on port 1883
On linux, you can use:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libmosquitto-dev
# and these for the binary
sudo apt-get install mosquitto mosquitto-clients
```
I should prob add a script for all of this..
